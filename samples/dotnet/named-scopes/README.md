# Web IQ named scopes (.NET)

Manage named scopes through the customer API, then use an API- or UI-authored
scope with the web endpoint. This self-contained console sample uses `HttpClient`
and Azure Identity, with explicit account/profile selection and no automatic
management retries or unscoped search fallback.

## Prerequisites and portal setup

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).
- A provisioned Web IQ account enabled for named-scope management and scoped web
  search. Confirm availability for your account.
- For management, an existing Entra application with an RSA private-key PFX and
  its public certificate registered in Entra. A human administrator must first
  register the workload and grant billing-account **CustomerApiAccess**.
- For search, a Web IQ API key for the profile in the scope's billing account,
  or a separately bound runtime Entra application with Web access.
- PowerShell 7.3 or later for the Windows examples, including quoted ETag arguments.

Use the shared [portal setup guide](../../python/named-scopes/docs/portal-setup.md)
for **Account settings > Application (Client) Ids > Add client ID**, the explicit
CustomerApiAccess grant, separate **Profile Management** runtime binding, and
**Scopes > New scope > Included / Excluded > Publish**.

CustomerApiAccess is broader than scopes and is not a runtime profile binding.
A runtime binding alone grants no management access. API-key search of a
UI-authored scope needs no management credential.

## Build and configure

Run from this sample directory:

```powershell
dotnet build src\WebIqScopes
$env:AZURE_TENANT_ID = "<directory-tenant-id>"
$env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID = "<application-client-id>"
$env:AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH = "<absolute-path-to-private-key.pfx>"
$password = Read-Host "Existing PFX password, if encrypted" -AsSecureString
$env:AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD = (
  [System.Net.NetworkCredential]::new("", $password).Password
)
```

Omit the password variable for an unencrypted PFX. This .NET sample loads PKCS12/PFX
with an ephemeral key and explicitly uses `ClientCertificateCredential`, requesting
`https://api.microsoft.ai/.default`. It does not silently use developer sign-in,
client secrets, or managed identity. A successful token request is not proof of
service authorization. The private key must remain outside source control.

For macOS/Linux, use `/` in command paths and `export NAME=value` for environment
variables. The application arguments are otherwise identical; preserve the double
quotes inside ETags. Environment variables are a secret-delivery mechanism, not a vault.

## Scenario 1: create and manage scopes

```powershell
dotnet run --project src\WebIqScopes -- discover
$env:WEBIQ_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID = "<billing-account-id-from-discovery>"
dotnet run --project src\WebIqScopes -- list --page-size 50
dotnet run --project src\WebIqScopes -- create ProductDocs --definition product-docs.json
dotnet run --project src\WebIqScopes -- get ProductDocs
```

Discovery calls `GET https://api.microsoft.ai/v1/customer/authorized-resources`.
It prints customers/accounts, including IDs for deliberate local selection, and
never chooses the first account. `200` with `[]` can indicate an unknown or
unassigned workload. Discovery's `permissions.canWrite` is a legacy billing-config
permission, not scope-write authority.

The collection is `/v1/customer/billing-accounts/{billingAccountId}/scopes`.
`list` follows every opaque continuation token unchanged, with a default page size
of 50 and maximum 100. It returns metadata/counts; `get` reads the site lists and
strong ETag. Create is a `POST`, not an upsert; duplicate names (case-insensitive)
or a full collection can return `409`.

The provided JSON includes `learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra` and excludes
`learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health`. Both `includeSites`
and `excludeSites` must be arrays. Edit both complete lists before replacing:

```powershell
$snapshot = dotnet run --no-build --project src\WebIqScopes -- get ProductDocs | ConvertFrom-Json
# Review the current definition and edit product-docs.json before continuing.
dotnet run --no-build --project src\WebIqScopes -- replace ProductDocs `
  --definition product-docs.json --if-match $snapshot.etag
```

Replace uses `PUT .../scopes/{name}`, with full replacement lists and the exact
strong quoted `If-Match`. It does not rename. Missing/null arrays are rejected;
explicit `[]` is intentional. Empty inclusions broaden to **all non-excluded
sources** and require `--allow-all-sites`; exclusions win.

On `412`, read the latest definition and ETag, reconcile competing changes, then
retry deliberately. Do not remove quotes, use `*`/weak tags, or blindly overwrite.
Create/update success and a new ETag acknowledge authoring, **not serving readiness**.
Propagation is asynchronous with no fixed delay/status API assumed here.

For optional cleanup, review the scope and delete only your dedicated sample resource:

```powershell
$snapshot = dotnet run --no-build --project src\WebIqScopes -- get ProductDocs | ConvertFrom-Json
dotnet run --no-build --project src\WebIqScopes -- delete ProductDocs --if-match $snapshot.etag
```

Delete requires `If-Match` and accepts `204` without parsing JSON. It also propagates
asynchronously. A timeout/server failure can leave an unknown write outcome; read
and reconcile before retrying. This sample rejects dot-only (`.` or `..`) management
identifiers rather than letting URL normalization change their meaning.

## Scenario 2: search with an API- or UI-authored scope

If an authorized author created and published `ProductDocs` in the Scopes UI,
skip the management steps. Use the same runtime request either way:

```powershell
$env:WEBIQ_API_KEY = "<api-key-for-the-intended-webiq-profile>"
dotnet run --project src\WebIqScopes -- search ProductDocs "Microsoft Entra app authentication"
```

Search sends `POST https://api.microsoft.ai/v3/search/web` with `x-apikey` and:

```json
{
  "query": "Microsoft Entra app authentication",
  "scopeName": "ProductDocs",
  "failOnMissingScope": true,
  "maxResults": 5,
  "language": "en",
  "region": "US",
  "contentFormat": "passage",
  "maxLength": 3000
}
```

`scopeName` is one string, never a selector array. Names use 1-128 ASCII letters,
digits, periods, underscores, and hyphens; lookup is case-insensitive.
`failOnMissingScope` stays `true`. A missing/unavailable scope fails rather than
silently searching the unscoped web. The CLI prints only the result count, not
the query, URLs, or retrieved content; that count is not propagation evidence.

For runtime Entra, configure the certificate variables for the application bound
to the intended profile and run:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src\WebIqScopes -- search ProductDocs "Microsoft Entra app authentication" --auth entra
```

If bound to multiple profiles, append `--app-id "<webiq-appid-for-the-intended-profile>"`.
This sends `?APPID=...`, the **Web IQ AppID**, not the Entra application/client ID.
API-key search must not include APPID. Management never uses APPID.

## Errors, privacy, and validation

Errors exit nonzero with status/fixed guidance, not raw server bodies or credential
details. Check input/availability on `400`, separate management/runtime grants on
`401`/`403`, duplicate/capacity conflicts on `409`, current ETags and reconciliation
on `412`/`428`, and service retry guidance on `429`. Requests time out after 30 seconds;
redirects are not followed. No management writes retry automatically.

Discovery/list/get intentionally print management data; discovery includes account
IDs. Review/redact stdout before sharing, avoid secret-bearing shell transcripts,
and clear secret environment variables after use. This sample adds no custom
telemetry or response files. Service-side handling is separate; see the
[Web IQ privacy guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/web-iq/resources/faq#privacy-and-data-handling).
Live search can incur usage charges; manually running management commands mutates
real resources. No grants, credentials, or live scopes are created by the tests.

```powershell
dotnet test tests\WebIqScopes.Tests
dotnet run --project src\WebIqScopes -- --help
```

Tests use a fake `HttpMessageHandler` and token-acquisition delegate, never service
access. They cover wire contracts, authentication separation, pagination, ETags,
conflicts, missing-scope failure, explicit empty lists, CLI safety, and sanitized
diagnostics. See the [Python guide](../../python/named-scopes/README.md) for additional
service semantics, and **Documentation** in the [Web IQ portal](https://webiq.microsoft.ai)
for guidance available to your account.
